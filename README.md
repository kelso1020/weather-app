# How's the Weather? - Weather Forecast App

## Description

I created this webpage for users to search any city name and receieve a response of that city's current weather as well as a five-day forcast of the wethaer. The webpage also catalogues each searched city into the recent searaches, which can be accessed as a clickable link.

## Usage

This webpage contains a form input to search any city name. The search response is both the current weather at that moment for that city and the predicted weather for each of the next five days in that city. Each city name that is searched is added to the Recent Searches list below the search input. Any city name in the Recent Searches list can be clicked, which will reload the webpage to that city's weather, giving users the option to toggle between recently searched city names.
